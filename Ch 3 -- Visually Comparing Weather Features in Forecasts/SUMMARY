The supplemental materials for Visually Comparing Weather Features in forecasts include: a video overview of WeaVER, our prototype tool, illustrating it's various interactive mechanisms; the sources which we used to derive the meteorological conventions which were integrated into our informed, default encoding recommendations; and an overview of the design process for WeaVER featuring early sketches, paper prototypes and early digital prototypes (along with source code and data).
